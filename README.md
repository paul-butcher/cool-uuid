Evaluating UUIDs for coolness

## What?

Some UUIDs are cooler than others.  This is post commit hook to evaluate the coolness of the hash of the last commit.

## Git Hashes?

I know Git hashes are not UUIDs.  This idea started many many years ago, when I used to work with COM and therefore saw a lot of UUIDs.

A friend recently pointed out a really cool git commit hash he had seen, and it inspired me to revive the idea.

## Status

This is the very beginning of a rather silly idea.
